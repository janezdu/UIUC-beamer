# UIUC-beamer
LaTeX Beamer theme with [UIUC colours](https://marketing.illinois.edu/design/color) on the Madrid template. 

I did not find an existing UIUC beamer template in LaTeX anywhere, so I've thrown together a quick theme using this [guide by Dr. Adam Noel](https://ramblingacademic.com/2015/12/08/how-to-quickly-overhaul-beamer-colors/).
